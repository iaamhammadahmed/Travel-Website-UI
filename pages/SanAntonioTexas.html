        It was a beautiful spring morning when I arrived in Kathmandu, the
        <br />
        capital city of Nepal. As soon as I stepped out of the airport, I was
        <br />
        struck by the vibrant colors, the chaos of the streets.

          San Antonio, city, seat (1837) of Bexar county, south-central Texas,
          U.S. It is situated at the headwaters of the San Antonio River on the
          Balcones Escarpment, about 80 miles (130 km) southwest of Austin. The
          second most-populous city in Texas, it is the focus of a metropolitan
          area that includes Alamo Heights, Castle Hills, Converse, Kirby, Leon
          Valley, Live Oak, Schertz, Terrell Hills, Universal City, and
          Windcrest. Inc. 1809. Area city, 412 square miles (1,067 square km).
          Pop. (2010) 1,327,407; San Antonio Metro Area, 2,142,508; (2020)

        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Spanish explorers first visited the site, then a camp of the Payaya
          Indians, in 1691. San Antonio was founded May 1, 1718, when a Spanish
          expedition from Mexico established the Mission San Antonio de Valero.
          The mission, later called the Alamo (Spanish: “Cottonwood”), was one
          of five founded in the area and was named for St. Anthony of Padua. On
          May 5 a presidio (military garrison) known as San Antonio de Béxar was
          established nearby. The site, on the river’s west bank, was a stopping
          place on the trail through the Texas wilderness between missions on
          the Rio Grande and those in East Texas.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          In 1731 settlers from the Canary Islands laid out the town of San
          Fernando de Béxar near the presidio, where a civilian community had
          been planned when the presidio and mission were established. During
          its early years the settlement suffered from raids by Apache and
          Comanche tribes. The mission was secularized in 1793 and became a
          military post. San Fernando de Béxar functioned as provincial capital
          from 1773 to 1824, but in subsequent years its political authority
          waned. By 1837, when it became a county seat of the Republic of Texas,
          it had been renamed San Antonio.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          At the time of Mexican independence in 1821, San Antonio was, along
          with Goliad and Nacogdoches, one of three established Spanish
          communities in Texas. In the summer of that year, Stephen Austin
          arrived in the city—then seat of the Spanish government in Texas—to
          follow through on a permit obtained by his father for the admission of
          300 U.S. families into the territory. In December 1835, at the outset
          of the Texas Revolution, Texan forces occupied the Alamo. They
          remained there until March 1836, when they were massacred by Mexican
          troops under Gen. Antonio López de Santa Anna following a 13-day
          siege. The presidio ceased to exist with the independence of Texas in
          April.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          In 1836 San Antonio was still the foremost city of Texas, with some
          2,500 inhabitants. It grew rapidly after independence, led by large
          numbers of German immigrants. During the last decades of the 19th
          century, San Antonio, as the starting point for the Chisholm Trail,
          became a major cattle centre, where herds were assembled for the
          overland drives to the railheads in Kansas.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          The city quickly became the commercial hub of the Southwest. The
          arrival of the first railroad in 1877 brought migrants from the
          American South, and Mexican immigrants settled there after the start
          of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. San Antonio was a major military
          centre during World Wars I and II, a factor that continued to dominate
          its economy in subsequent decades. In 1968 a world’s exposition, known
          as HemisFair, was held there to commemorate the city’s 250th
          anniversary and to celebrate its cultural ties with Latin America. In
          1981 Henry Cisneros was elected the city’s first Hispanic mayor since
          the mid-19th century; Cisneros served until 1989. In 2001 Ed Garza was
          elected the city’s second modern-era Hispanic mayor and was in office
          until 2005.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          San Antonio’s character is a colourful blend of Mexican and Texan
          culture. It is 150 miles (240 km) from the Mexican border at Laredo,
          on one of the most-traveled routes to Mexico. Much of its population
          (about three-fifths) is of Hispanic (mainly Mexican) descent, and many
          are Spanish-speaking or bilingual. It preserves much of its historical
          atmosphere and embraces its cultural diversity. Remains of
          18th-century Spanish structures dot the city, contrasting with modern
          office buildings.
