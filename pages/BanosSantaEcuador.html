        It was a beautiful spring morning when I arrived in Kathmandu, the
        <br />
        capital city of Nepal. As soon as I stepped out of the airport, I was
        <br />
        struck by the vibrant colors, the chaos of the streets.

          Baños de Agua Santa, Ecuador is a great place to reboot your
          adventurous spirit whether its whitewater rafting down class III
          rapids, downhill mountain biking by a series of waterfalls, ziplining
          at nose-bleed heights through canyons, or paddling dugout canoes on
          the Puyo river in Amazonia.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Downtown Baños is not quiet. It’s bustling year-round with gap-year
          backpackers swigging beers at downtown bars, travelers grabbing
          cappuccinos in Starbucks-like cafes, and vendors hawking guided tours
          from small shops lining the streets offering “just for you” discounts
          for those tackling the myriad of outdoor sports.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          For the more laidback traveler looking for a relaxing spa vacation,
          massages start at $25 and can be found on just about every street
          corner. For as little as $3 per person you can enjoy the healing
          waters of the hot mineral springs with temperatures up to 130 F heated
          by Tungurahua, the nearby active volcano. It’s a town that has
          successfully meshed extreme sports, relaxing spas, and an active
          Volcano. Expats love it—whether as a vacation spot, or place to settle
          amongst nature.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Baños is touristy, crowded, and not that scenic until you step just
          outside of town and you’ll see why it owns the moniker “Adventure
          Capital of Ecuador” and you will be stymied by its beauty. Baños de
          Agua Santa, which means “Baths of Sacred Water” is appropriately
          named, with more than 60 waterfalls, hot mineral springs, and rivers
          encasing the city. The population is less than 20,000 but more than
          doubles during tourist season—which is pretty much every day. The
          climate ranges between 55 F at night up to about 80 F during the day,
          even though it’s at an elevation of 1,820 meters (5,971 feet) but
          stays warm due to its proximity to the equator. It’s a mere
          three-and-a-half-hour drive south from Quito, Ecuador through the
          Andes, and the trip to get to Baños is worth the ride.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          The town seems to collect monikers and is also known as the “Gateway
          to the Amazon,” because it is the starting point to explore the
          jungle’s offerings including national parks, spewing volcanoes, and
          llamas who graze by the roads. It’s popularity as a tourist
          destination is marked by the more than 100 hotels ranging in prices
          from backpacker hostels starting at $20 a night to upscale haciendas
          nearing $100 for two, and loads of restaurants lining the downtown
          streets.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          The locals who live year-round in Baños are firmly planted in the
          tourist industry, except for the indigenous population who live on
          farms outside of Baños and supply the endless lineup of fresh
          vegetables and fruits, roasted pigs on spits, and textiles which are
          hawked at the farmer’s market located downtown.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Because it’s a tourist destination, the amenities are top notch, with
          strong internet, medical clinics (it is an extreme sports town after
          all), and a hospital in Ambato, which sits an hour away. Spanish is
          the predominate language so arm yourself with Google Translate.
          Because Baños is international, you’ll hear German, Polish, French,
          Swedish spoken everywhere and there’s usually a friendly bi-lingual
          passer-by who will help with translations.
