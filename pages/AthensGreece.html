          Athens, historic city and capital of Greece. Many of Classical
          civilization’s intellectual and artistic ideas originated there, and
          the city is generally considered to be the birthplace of Western
          civilization.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Athens lies 5 miles (8 km) from the Bay of Phaleron, an inlet of the
          Aegean (Aigaíon) Sea where Piraeus (Piraiévs), the port of Athens, is
          situated, in a mountain-girt arid basin divided north-south by a line
          of hills. Greater Athens has an area of 165 square miles (427 square
          km). The Kifisós River, only a trickle in summer, flows through the
          western half; the Ilisós River, often dry, traverses the eastern half.
          The surrounding mountains—Párnis, 4,636 feet (1,413 metres);
          Pentelicus (Pendéli), 3,631 feet; Hymettos (Imittós), 3,365 feet; and
          Aigáleon, 1,535 feet—add to the impression of barrenness. Yet such
          considerations are superficial when compared with the fecundity of
          Athens’s bequests to the world, such as its philosophy, its
          architecture, its literature, and its political ideals.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Athens, with its tall buildings and contemporary shops, is the first
          European city when approached from the Middle East. When approached
          from the west, from elsewhere in Europe, what strikes the visitor is
          the influence of the East—in the food, music, and clamorous street
          life—perhaps vestiges of a time when Athens was divorced from European
          society under the yoke of Ottoman rule. Nevertheless, it is wrong to
          say that Athens is a mixture of East and West: it is Greek and, more
          particularly, Athenian. The city, after all, nurtured Western
          civilization thousands of years ago. Athens remains on the world stage
          to this day.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Notably, in 2004 the world came to the city for the Olympic Games,
          which spurred a dramatic makeover for Athens. In addition to building
          a raft of new sports venues and facilities (including a stadium
          designed by Santiago Calatrava), Athens undertook massive
          transportation infrastructure improvements that included dramatic
          expansion of public transportation and the construction of a new
          international airport.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Some three centuries after the death of Pericles (429 BCE), Athenians
          entered upon a period of bondage that lasted almost 2,000 years. The
          city was freed in 1833, and in the following 170 years it was the
          scene of more than a dozen revolutions, another brutal foreign
          occupation, and a civil war of especial savagery. This long history of
          passion and suffering has had considerable effect on the Athenian
          character. The core of that character is an implacable will to
          survive, buttressed by a profound sense of loyalty (especially to the
          family) and patriotism. The Greek Orthodox Church, which is directed
          by a synod sitting in Athens, was a main force in keeping alive the
          Greek language, tradition, and literature when such things were
          forbidden, and most people still support it.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          The millennia of oppression, instead of driving the Athenians into
          obtuse moroseness, have honed their wit and rendered them tough but
          supple, while centuries of privation have only preserved their warmth
          and generosity. The long oral tradition, alive even under the invader,
          has reflected and stimulated a taste for rich talk. Of course, the
          poetic impulse to make a good story better leads to considerable
          exaggeration in daily conversation, suiting a vanity that goes with a
          sharp-edged sense of personal and family honour and the spoiling of
          children. The ancient heroes, too, were vain about both themselves and
          honour, boasting as much about outwitting the enemy as about
          outfighting him.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          The climate of Athens is benign: frost is rare (the minimum
          temperature is 32 °F, or 0 °C) and snow seldom lies, while the
          summers, though hot (maximum temperature is 99 °F, or 37 °C), are dry,
          and a fresh northeasterly wind often blows by day. The nights are
          cool. The climate of the city permits outdoor activity the year round
          and has had an important effect on both the style of architecture and
          the life and political institutions of the city.
