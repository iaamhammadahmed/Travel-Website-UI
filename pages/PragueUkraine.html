        I visited Prague, the beautiful capital city of the Czech Republic,<br />
        and one of my favorite places in the city was the Petrin Hill. The<br />
        Petrin Hill is a green oasis in the heart of Prague.

          Prague is one of my favorite cities in the world. With its winding
          cobblestone streets, medieval buildings, and spacious squares, the
          city is a photographer’s dream come true. Much of the architecture
          dates to the middle ages, giving the city an unrivaled historic charm.
          Over the last decade, Prague has become one of the most visited
          destinations in Europe. When I first visited in 2006, it was popular
          but still “off the beaten path.” Today, it’s a huge tourist
          destination and, now, a big spot for people to move to thanks to its
          growing digital nomad scene.

          Built around 870 CE by Prince Borivoj, Prague Castle dominates the
          city skyline. Once the seat of Czech Kings, here you can explore the
          castle gardens and much of the grounds for free. The St. Vitus
          Cathedral is the most famous building here and is home to the tombs of
          saints and rulers in Czech history. Today, the castle remains the
          official residence of the Czech President. During your visit, you can
          view the Czech crown jewels along with precious historic artifacts
          from the Bohemian kings who once ruled the region. Tickets are 250 CZK
          while in-depth guided tours (including admission) are 846 CZK.

          This square is home to historic churches, the astronomical clock,
          cafes, tourist shops, and the occasional football (soccer) game. The
          area was once a bustling marketplace and an important crossroads on
          European trade routes. You can enjoy centuries worth of architecture,
          such as the Gothic Church of Our Lady before Týn or the Baroque St.
          Nicholas Church. An astronomical clock is perched on the Old Town
          Hall. Originally installed in 1410, it is the oldest operational
          astronomical clock in the world. Despite being the biggest tourist
          area of Prague, Old Town square has virtually remained untouched since
          the 10th century and remains the historical center of Prague.

          Originally constructed in 1357 by King Charles IV, this is one of the
          oldest standing bridges in the world. For hundreds of years, until the
          1840s, the bridge that connects the Castle District to Old Town was
          the only way to cross the Vltava River. Along the bridge, you’ll find
          street artists, musicians, dancers, and other entertainers. Take in
          the incredible statues that line the bridge, including the bronze
          statue of John Nepomuk. Locals believe that touching the statue brings
          good luck. There’s almost always a sea of people here so if you want
          to beat the crowds get there early in the morning or late at night.

          Since John Lennon’s death in 1980, his face (and lyrics and political
          graffiti) has been painted on the plain wall opposite the French
          Embassy. Created by the Czech youth, the wall represented freedom of
          speech and non-violent resistance in what was then communist
          Czechoslovakia. Although it was painted over a number of times, the
          art was always re-posted and so they have “let it be.” It’s now the
          only place in the city where graffiti is legal, and you can often
          catch street performers singing Beatles songs nearby. The wall serves
          as both a memorial for John Lennon as well as an iconic symbol of love
          and peace.

          This museum was founded in 1818 and houses over 2,000 exhibits and 14
          million items relating to natural history, art, music, and
          librarianship. Located in Wenceslas Square, the main building, a
          19th-century Neo-Renaissance masterpiece, reopened in 2019 after an
          8-year reconstruction. Tickets are 260 CZK for the main museum. In
          addition to the main building, there are exhibitions scattered amongst
          over a dozen other buildings in Prague, each with its own admission
          (50–170 CZK per person).

          Built in the 15th century, this intricate clock in the main square is
          one of the city’s most popular attractions. Every hour, on the hour,
          people gather in front of the clock to watch the Procession of the
          Twelve Apostles. It’s a bit anticlimactic and I wouldn’t go out of the
          way to see it but since you’ll probably pass through the square often
          you might as well check it out since it’s free.
