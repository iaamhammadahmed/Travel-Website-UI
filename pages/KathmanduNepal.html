        It was a beautiful spring morning when I arrived in Kathmandu, the
        <br />
        capital city of Nepal. As soon as I stepped out of the airport, I was
        <br />
        struck by the vibrant colors, the chaos of the streets.

        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Kathmandu, capital of Nepal. It lies in a hilly region near the
          confluence of the Baghmati and Vishnumati rivers, at an elevation of
          4,344 feet (1,324 metres) above sea level.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          It was founded in 723 by Raja Gunakamadeva. Its early name was
          Manju-Patan; the present name refers to a wooden temple (kath, “wood”;
          mandir, “temple” or “edifice”) said to have been built from the wood
          of a single tree by Raja Lachmina Singh in 1596. A building,
          supposedly the original, still stands in the central square and is
          used for the accommodation of sadhus (holy men). Kathmandu served as
          the seat of the ruling Shah family of the Gurkha people from 1768 to
          2008.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          The city has become the country’s most important business and
          commercial centre through the efforts of its Newar merchant families.
          In the 1970s the construction of new roads and the expansion of air
          service were centred upon Kathmandu, making it the hub of the national
          transportation system, which for centuries was limited to footpaths.
          Many of the townspeople are engaged in agriculture, the Newar
          preferring to live in the city. Tribhuvan University was chartered in
          1959.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Kathmandu’s two main streets contrast strongly to the older sectors of
          narrow streets and brick houses adorned with carved doors and windows.
          Destruction caused by an earthquake in 1934 resulted in the
          construction of many modern-style buildings. The city’s most notable
          building is the old palace of the Malla kings, which includes Taleju
          temple (1549), built by Raja Mahindra Malla. The palace’s main gate is
          guarded by a figure of the god Hanuman; in a small, adjoining square
          are several pagoda-style temples.

          To the east is Tundi Khel, the parade ground, in the centre of which
          is a stone platform surrounding a tree, from which important
          government pronouncements were formerly made first to the army.
          Between it and the city is a tall watchtower built by Bhim Sen Thapa,
          a former prime minister. On the outskirts of Kathmandu are many
          palaces built by the Rana family, the most imposing of which is the
          Singha Palace, once the official residence of the hereditary prime
          ministers and now housing the government secretariat. About 3 miles (5
          km) northeast is the great white dome of Bodhnath, a Buddhist shrine
          revered by Tibetan Buddhists. The surrounding Kathmandu Valley, noted
          for its vast historic and cultural importance, was designated a UNESCO
          World Heritage site in 1979. Vulnerable to urban sprawl, it was placed
          on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2003 but was removed from
          the list in 2007 after concerted conservation efforts from the
          government partially mitigated concerns.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Festivals in Kathmandu include, in spring, the Shivaratri and the
          Machendra Jatra with its procession bearing the image of the god
          Machendra; in late summer, the Gai Jatra (festival of the cow); and,
          in early autumn, the Indra Jatra, during which the goddess Devi,
          represented by a young girl, is carried in procession.

          On April 25, 2015, a magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck central Nepal,
          its epicentre about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Kathmandu. Initial
          estimates on how many people had been killed in the country by the
          quake were more than 1,500, but that number quickly grew as rescue and
          recovery workers reached more-remote locations. In all, some 9,000
          people died and about 16,800 were injured throughout Nepal by the main
          quake and numerous aftershocks. Kathmandu was severely damaged,
          especially the buildings in its historic centre, and tens of thousands
          were made homeless. Pop. (2001) 671,846; (2011) 1,003,285.
