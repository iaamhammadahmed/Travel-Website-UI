        I had always been interested in spirituality, so I decided to take a
        <br />
        year-long journey to India to explore various religious practices and
        <br />traditions.

          Mumbai, city, capital of Maharashtra state, southwestern India. It is
          the country’s financial and commercial centre and its principal port
          on the Arabian Sea.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Located on Maharashtra’s coast, Mumbai is India’s most-populous city,
          and it is one of the largest and most densely populated urban areas in
          the world. It was built on a site of ancient settlement, and it took
          its name from the local goddess Mumba—a form of Parvati, the consort
          of Shiva, one of the principal deities of Hinduism—whose temple once
          stood in what is now the southeastern section of the city. It became
          known as Bombay during the British colonial period, the name possibly
          an Anglicized corruption of Mumbai or perhaps of Bom Baim (“Good
          Harbour”), supposedly a Portuguese name for the locale. The name
          Mumbai was restored officially in 1995, although Bombay remained in
          common usage.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Mumbai, long the centre of India’s cotton textile industry,
          subsequently developed a highly diversified manufacturing sector that
          included an increasingly important information technology (IT)
          component. In addition, the city’s commercial and financial
          institutions are strong and vigorous, and Mumbai serves as the
          country’s financial hub. It suffers, however, from some of the
          perennial problems of many large expanding industrial cities: air and
          water pollution, widespread areas of substandard housing, and
          overcrowding. The last problem is exacerbated by the physical limits
          of the city’s island location. Area about 239 square miles (619 square
          km). Pop. (2001) 11,978,450; urban agglom., 16,434,386; (2011)
          12,478,447; urban agglom., 18,414,288.
