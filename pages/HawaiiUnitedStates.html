          Hawaii, constituent state of the United States of America. Hawaii
          (Hawaiian: Hawai‘i) became the 50th U.S. state on August 21, 1959.
          Hawaii is a group of volcanic islands in the central Pacific Ocean.
          The islands lie 2,397 miles (3,857 km) from San Francisco, California,
          to the east and 5,293 miles (8,516 km) from Manila, in the
          Philippines, to the west. The capital is Honolulu, located on the
          island of Oahu.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Hawaii was characterized by Mark Twain as “the loveliest fleet of
          islands that lies anchored in any ocean.” The name is thought to
          derive from Hawaiki, the former name of Raiatea, the ancestral home of
          Polynesians.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Hawaii is economically vigorous, with diversified agriculture and
          manufacturing. Hawaiian activities of national and international
          importance include research and development in oceanography,
          geophysics, astronomy, satellite communications, and biomedicine.
          Often called the Crossroads of the Pacific, the state is strategically
          important to the global defense system of the United States and serves
          as a transportation hub of the Pacific basin. Finally, Hawaii is a
          cultural centre and a major tourist mecca. Area 10,970 square miles
          (28,412 square km). Population (2020) 1,455,271; (2022 est.)
          1,440,196.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          The land area of the state of Hawaii consists of the tops of a chain
          of emerged volcanic mountains that form 8 major islands and 124
          islets, stretching in a 1,500-mile (2,400-km) crescent from Kure
          Island in the west to the island of Hawaii in the east. The eight
          major islands at the eastern end of the chain are, from west to east,
          Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii. Each
          volcanic mountain formed during the transit of the Pacific Plate
          across a hotspot (a region of Earth’s upper mantle that upwells to
          melt through the crust) located beneath the central Pacific Ocean, and
          erupting magma added mass to the crust above.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          The origin of Hawaii’s islands, islets, and seamounts can be traced to
          at least 70 million years ago, near the end of the Cretaceous Period
          (145 million to 66 million years ago). Volcanic activity has become
          dormant, with the exception of the emergent volcanoes of Mauna Loa,
          Kilauea, and the Lō‘ihi Seamount. Mauna Loa and Kilauea are located on
          the easternmost and largest island, Hawaii (often referred to as the
          “Big Island”), where spectacular eruptions and lava flows take place
          from time to time. The Lō‘ihi Seamount, a growing volcano that could
          break the surface of the ocean tens of thousands of years from the
          present, is located 18.6 miles (30 km) southeast of the island of
          Hawaii. The highest Hawaiian mountains are Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa,
          both on the island of Hawaii, reaching 13,796 feet (4,205 metres) and
          13,678 feet (4,169 metres) above sea level, respectively.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          There has been little erosion in the geologically young areas, where
          the terrain is domelike or scattered with hardened lava, and the
          volcanic craters are clearly defined. In the older areas the mountains
          have been shaped and eroded by sea, rain, and wind. Their aspects thus
          include sharp and craggy silhouettes; abrupt, vertically grooved
          cliffs pocked with caves; deep valleys; collapsed craters (calderas);
          and coastal plains. The powerful Pacific surf, churning and crashing
          against the fringing coral shelves and the lava shorelines, has
          carried minute shells onto the shore and reduced coral and large
          shells to sand, creating the state’s famous expanses of beach.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Heavy rainfall in mountainous areas produces an extremely voluminous
          runoff, which is responsible for the erosion that forms the numerous
          grooves, ridges, and V-shaped valleys characteristic of the older
          volcanic islands such as Kauai and Oahu. The action of rain combined
          with waves has had a particularly dramatic effect on the more exposed
          windward sections of the islands.
