          Budapest, city, capital of Hungary, and seat of Pest megye (county).
          The city is the political, administrative, industrial, and commercial
          centre of Hungary. The site has been continuously settled since
          prehistoric times and is now the home of about one-fifth of the
          country’s population. Area city, 203 square miles (525 square km).
          Pop. (2011) 1,729,040; (2019 est.) 1,752,286.

        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Once called the “Queen of the Danube,” Budapest has long been the
          focal point of the nation and a lively cultural centre. The city
          straddles the Danube (Hungarian: Duna) River in the magnificent
          natural setting where the hills of western Hungary meet the plains
          stretching to the east and south. It consists of two parts, Buda and
          Pest, which are situated on opposite sides of the river and connected
          by a series of bridges.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Although the city’s roots date to Roman times and even earlier, modern
          Budapest is essentially an outgrowth of the 19th-century empire of
          Austria-Hungary, when Hungary was three times larger than the present
          country. Hungary’s reduction in size following World War I did not
          prevent Budapest from becoming, after Berlin, the second largest city
          in central Europe. One out of five Hungarians now lives in the
          capital, which, as the seat of government and the centre of Hungarian
          transport and industry, dominates all aspects of national life. Tens
          of thousands of commuters converge on Budapest daily, more than half
          the country’s university students attend school in the city, and about
          half the country’s income from foreign tourism is earned there.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Budapest stood apart from the relatively drab capitals of the other
          Soviet-bloc countries; it maintained an impression of plenty, with
          smart shops, good restaurants, and other amenities. The dissolution of
          the Soviet bloc and Hungary’s transition away from socialism brought
          Budapest new opportunities for prosperity and an influx of Western
          tourists—along with the stresses of transition to a more Western-style
          economy. The city, including the banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle
          Quarter, and Andrássy Avenue, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage
          site in 1987.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Strategically placed at the centre of the Carpathian Basin, Budapest
          lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia (Hungarian:
          Dunántúl) with the Great Alfold (Great Hungarian Plain; Hungarian:
          Nagy Magyar Alföld). The wide Danube was always fordable at this point
          because of a few islands in the middle of the river. The city has
          marked topographical contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river
          terraces and hills of the western side, while the considerably larger
          Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river’s
          opposite bank.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          The climate of Budapest is transitional between the extreme conditions
          of the Great Alfold and the more temperate climate of Transdanubia,
          with its abundant rainfall. Mean annual temperature is in the low 50s
          F (about 11 °C), ranging from a July average in the low 70s F (about
          22 °C) to the low 30s F (about −1 °C) in January. Mean annual
          precipitation is 24 inches (600 mm). Winter snowfalls can be heavy,
          and the temperature may fall below 5 °F (−15 °C), but, on the other
          hand, heat waves combined with humidity in the summer can make the air
          oppressive. Flooding in Pest was endemic before the river was
          regulated in the 19th century. The Danube (blue only in the Johann
          Strauss waltz) has become heavily contaminated, and air pollution,
          from which the inhabitants of Buda have largely been able to escape,
          has afflicted most districts in Pest.
        </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-xs font-medium text-[#000000]">
          Buda was the kernel of settlement in the Middle Ages, and the cobbled
          streets and Gothic houses of the castle town have preserved its old
          layout. Until the late 18th century, Pest remained a tiny enclave, but
          then its population exploded, leaving Buda far behind. In the latter
          half of the 20th century, growth has been more evenly distributed
          between the two parts. Contemporary Budapest covers 203 square miles
          (525 square km), of which about half is built up. Buda’s hilltops,
          still crowned by trees; the Danube flanked by three lower hills; the
          bridges; Margit (Margaret) Island; and the riverfront of Pest lend a
          remarkable visual identity to the city.
